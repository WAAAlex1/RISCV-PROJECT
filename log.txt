Dag 1:
    Done:
        Git
        Project Setup (IntelliJ SBT)
        Pipeline stage 1: Fetching (IF stage)
        Test Pipeline stage 1: Fetching (IF stage)
    Questions:
        PC as reg? Mem delay 1 cycle
            fixed
        How is instr mem filled?
                Serial port, vec in scala or bootloader
Dag 2:
    Husk
        Vi ignorerer begge de to første bits på jump imm fordi vi kun skal jumpe mindst 4 byte ad gangen
    Done
        ID Stage
        ID Stage testing

    Questions:
        What is the alternative to the control signals in the book? Answer: Nothing
        In the figure 4.49, what are the ALU control inputs actually here?
        
Dag 3:
    Husk:
        Flyt ALUcontrol ting til IDStage?

        1. 4-bit signal (aluOpSelect) to ALU regarding what operation it needs to execute.
        	1. Decoded and interpreted in ALU Using a Switch

        	2. Encoding of the 4-bit signal is:

        		0000:  	ADD
        		0001:	SLL
        		0010:	SLT
        		0011:	SLTU
        		0100:	XOR
        		0101:	SRL
        		0110:	OR
        		0111:	AND
        		1000:	SUB
        		1101:	SRA

        		1001:	BEQ
        		1010:	BNE
        		1011:	BLT
        		1100:	BGE
        		1110:	BLTU
        		1111:	BGEU


        2. aluOpSelect created in ID-stage (as this needs logic)
        	1. Based on funct3 and funct7
